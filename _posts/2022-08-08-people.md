### Lauren Buckley, Professor
#### [CV](/assets/files/BuckleyCV_ext.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iik-8q8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Wiki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iik-8q8AAAAJ&hl=en)
Lauren joined the UW Biology Department in July 2013. She previously majored in Biology and Math as an undergrad at Williams College, conducted graduate research at Stanford, held postdoctoral fellowships at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and the Santa Fe Institute, and was on the faculty at the University of North Carolina.  Some days it feels like we’re making progress in improving forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change; other days it feels like a foolhardy enterprise. Most days are fun. Lauren enjoys tromping around the mountains of Colorado chasing butterflies and grasshoppers during resurvey projects examining responses to recent climate change. Checking out the sites in winter on skis is her favorite. She is excited to be starting a local project where she can walk to a field site from her office.

### Monica Sheffer, Postdoc
Monica received her PhD from the University of Greifswald in Germany, as part of the “RESPONSE” graduate training group, which focuses on understanding how organisms respond to novel and changing environments. Monica employs interdisciplinary approaches to address this issue, and her work aims to integrate information from all levels of biological organization, from the molecular and physiological level, up to phenotypic outcomes for individuals, and how those outcomes shape population dynamics. At the University of Washington, Monica is studying how survival and fecundity constraints vary with elevation in a montane grasshopper system.


<img src="/assets/img/people/Julia.png" alt="Julia"  height="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
### Julia Smith, Graduate student
Julia is interested in integrating quantitative and empirical methods to understand the ecological impacts of climate change. In the Buckley lab, she studies grasshopper thermoregulatory behavior and energetics (see the field season picture on the left). She is modeling how climate change may have affected behavior, energetics, and ultimately fitness over the past 70 years. She is also passionate about education (especially teaching quantitative methods in biology) and hopes to get more involved in education research soon! In her free time, she plays guitar, hangs out with her ill-mannered cat, plays board games with friends, and makes elaborate color-coded weekly schedules in Excel that she will never actually follow.


<img src="/assets/img/people/Taylor.png" alt="Taylor" height="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
### Taylor Hatcher, Research Technician

Taylor comes from Wyoming, where she received her bachelor's in Biology at the University of Wyoming. While at the University of Wyoming, she conducted and participated in undergraduate and post-bachelor research on how extreme and varying temperatures impact various species of bumble bees. In the Buckley Lab, Taylor is a Research Technician on board to assist in the research associated with the WARP (Washington Resurvey of Pierids) Project. Taylor is broadly interested in thermal physiology and how climate change impacts pollinators' life history traits. Taylor is passionate about all things animal-related and loves having the opportunity to work with live animals in the lab and the field. When she's not in the lab, you'll find her indulging in her love for the outdoors, accompanied by her dog, usually hiking or mountain biking.
