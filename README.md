## Configuration

### Sample Posts

Visit the [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/) to find sample posts that show what different types of text formatting look like. You can find these posts in the `_posts` folder, which show what the best practices for setting up your own site are.

### Site Variables

To change site build settings, edit the `_config.yml` file found in the root of your repository, which you can tweak however you like. More information on configuration settings and plugins can be found on [the Jekyll documentation site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/). This is also where you will be able to customize the title, description, and the author/owner of your site.

If you are hosting your site on GitHub Pages, then committing a change to the `_config.yml` file will force a rebuild of your site with Jekyll. Any changes made should be viewable soon after. If you are hosting your site locally, then you must run `jekyll serve` again for the changes to take place.

In the `settings.yml` file found in the `_data` folder, you will be able to customize your site settings, such as setting Disqus comments, Google Analytics, what shows up in your menu, and social media information.

### Adding Menu Pages

The menu pages are found in the `menu` folder in the root directory, and can be added to your menu in the `settings.yml` file.

### Posts

You will the site pages in the `_posts` directory. To add new pages, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention of `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. 

### Layouts

There are two main layout options that are included with Millennial: post and page. Layouts are specified through the [YAML front block matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). Any file that contains a YAML front block matter will be processed by Jekyll. For example:

```
---
layout: post
title: "Example Post"
---
```

Examples of what posts looks like can be found in the `_posts` directory, which includes this post you are reading right now. Posts are the basic blog post layout, which includes a header image, post content, author name, date published, social media sharing links, and related posts.

Pages are essentially the post layout without any of the extra features of the posts layout. An example of what pages look like can be found at the [documentation page](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/pages/documentation.html).

In addition to the two main layout options above, there are also custom layouts that have been created for the [home page](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/) and the [contacts page](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/pages/contact.html). These are simply just page layouts with some [Liquid template code](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Check out the `index.html` file in the root directory for what the code looks like.

### YAML Front Block Matter

The recommended YAML front block is:

```
---
layout:
title:
author:
categories:
tags: []
image:
---
```

`layout` specifies which layout to use, `title` is the page or post title, `categories` can be used to better organize your posts, `tags` are used when generating related posts based on the topic of the post, and `image` specifies which images to use. Have a look at some posts in the `_posts` directory to see how these variables are set.
